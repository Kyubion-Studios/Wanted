# This is Wanted!
Embark on thrilling hunts, track down elusive mobs, and reap rewards before the day's end. Are you up for the challenge?

## Mob Hunting
- Almost every day, a mob will be announced to all players along with its reward.
- The player who finds and kills that mob first receives the reward and no other player can get it again.
- If no player finds that mob by the end of that day, no one will receive anything and another hunt will begin the next day. (Sleeping will make the night go by the same way it would without sleeping)

⚠️ This pack has translation, but it uses the keys available within the vanilla game and may look weird in some languages.
